A very early, buggy, unpolished version of a http client for `auditing` API endpoints
Allows one to make http requests.

## Running locally

git clone https://github.com/njenga5/http-requests-client.git http-client
cd http-client
npm install
npm start
```

### Known issues

* _Does not have functionality for other body types except JSON_ 

### Plans
* _Add support for more http methods_
* _Add ability to cancel requests_
